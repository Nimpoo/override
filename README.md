## OverRide is the last `ISO` challenge of the trilogy. It's supposed to be the continuation of [RainFall](https://github.com/nimpoo/rainfall), and the hardest of the trilogy. It's basically the same as the previous `ISO` challenges, but the difficulty is increased : each levels have a binary to exploit.

For each levels, the methods are the same. All the files are `ELF binary` and the process will be the same as the previous challenges :
1. Test the program
1. Decompilation and/or disassembly
3. Analyse the code
4. Exploit the vulnerability

### Basically, reverse engineering (again)

Each levels can be a variation of all the exploitation we have learn in [RainFall](https://github.com/nimpoo/rainfall). To be honest, this challenge just help me to understand more about the exploitation and the security of the system and how `gdb` can be used to debug a program and khow more about the memory and the registers.

### It's a a cool project but a bit repetitive after finishing [RainFall](https://github.com/nimpoo/rainfall)

You'll see each `README.md` are shorter and go to the point directly, I want to make shorter and more efficient write-up for see how it can be done (and some levels are so incredibly easy).

(I am Garp and Noah is Kuzan, despite the fact that Noah was more my coach than I was for him in all the challenges)

# Virtual Machine Setup

Again, it's the same setup as [RainFall](https://github.com/nimpoo/rainfall), the script can be found [here](assets/run.sh).

After launching the script, I connect to the virtual machine with `ssh` :

```sh
âžœ  ~ ssh level00@127.0.0.1 -p 4242
```

I use `scp` for the file transfer :

```sh
âžœ  ~ scp -P 4242 level00@127.0.0.1:/home/user/level00/level00 /Users/mayoub/Desktop
```

## Summary from `level00` to `level08` :

- [`level00`](level00/README.md) : **Hardcoded Secret** - Decompilation and disassembly
- [`level01`](level01/README.md) : **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow** - `Ret2libc`
- [`level02`](level02/README.md) : **Format String Attack** - Stack accessibility
- [`level03`](level03/README.md) : **Hashing Algorithm** - `XOR` encryption (but this level is passed brainlessly)
- [`level04`](level04/README.md) : **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow** and **Process Manipulation** - `Ret2libc` and `gdb` (`follow-fork-mode`)
- [`level05`](level05/README.md) : **Format String Attack** - `GOT` overwriting by `shellcode` injection + `printf` limitation (**`high`/`low` order bytes**)
- [`level06`](level06/README.md) : **Binary recration** or **Code Skipping** - Easy serial number bypass or **overriding** security checks with `gdb` (`jump` command)
- [`level07`](level07/README.md) : **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow** and **Integer Overflow** - `Ret2Libc`
- [`level08`](level08/README.md) : **Reverse Engineering (only)** - file managing manipulation

## BONUS - `level09` :

- [`level09`](level09/README.md) : **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow** - `Ret2win` by exploiting **1 byte**
